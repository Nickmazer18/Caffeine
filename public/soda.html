    <p>Three of the most popular soda categories with caffeine are:</p>
</div>


      <div class="cola">

      <div class="cola-graph">
        <p>Coca Cola could be considered the earliest "energy drink" - although not marketed as such - it was one of the first carbonated drinks to contain caffeine.
The drink was first made in 1886 - where it supposedly had a very small level of cocaine in it - due to the extract of coca leaf being an ingredient. However, given that the formula has always remained secret - this may simply be an embellishment. </p>

  <div class="diet-soda">
      <h2>Diet soda</h2>
      <img src="img/dietsoda1.jpg" alt="diet soda" width: "100%"; height: "auto";>
      <p>Diet Coke is one of the most-caffeinated sodas with 76mg of caffeine per 12-ounce can. It ranks ahead of Diet Pepsi, which has the same amount of caffeine as regular Coca-Cola (34mg per 12-ounce can).</p>

      <div class="flavored-soda">

     <h2>Flavored sodas</h2>

     <p>Dr. Pepper, one of the most-popular flavored sodas, has 68mg of caffeine in a 20-ounce bottle. Mountain Dew is one of the most-caffeinated sodas with 91 mg, second to only Pepsi Zero Sugar (115mg per 12-ounce can). </p>
